Human activity recognition is an important task in the field of wearable computing.
Human Activity Recognition has applications in various domains including healthcare, sports, and security. 
This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to accurately classify human activities such as walking, standing, sitting, etc. based on sensor data.
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from smartphones worn by participants performing different activities. 
The dataset is split into training and testing sets and each sample is labeled with the corresponding activity.
